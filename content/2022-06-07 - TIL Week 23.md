A roundup of the things I learned in the 23rd week of 2022.

## Technical

* You can use interface inheritance to pass versions of entities back from a bounded context use case rather than using a DTO. [See here for a php example](https://github.com/Abban/DTOInterfaceTest). It works better in C# though because it's more type strict. Php will still allow you to call a method that exists on an object but not in it's interface.
