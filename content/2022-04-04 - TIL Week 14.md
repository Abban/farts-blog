A roundup of the things I learned in the 14th week of 2022.

## Technical

* Learned how the V2 PayPal API works. It's pretty similar to Stripe. Created a [Test Application](https://github.com/wmde/fundraising-paypal-api-test).
* When using Nginx with Docker don't mount your nginx.conf file into the conf.d folder as there's a default file in there that will override it. Instead mount a folder containing your nginx.conf as the conf.d folder.

## Professional

* Don't expect external developers to follow your workflows/procedures if you don't give them a bunch of documentation. Add specific developer guides alongside general technical READMEs.

## Personal Notes

*Coming soon to a post near you*
