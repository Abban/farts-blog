A roundup of the things I learned in the 8th week of 2022.

## Technical

* [`LAST_INSERT_ID()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-functions.html#function_last-insert-id) in MySQL is transactional and will return the last ID per connection.
* Using php PDO you need to use [`beginTransaction()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.begintransaction.php) in order to make your query transactional and ensure you get the last ID back correctly.
* Php 8.1 enums can have [methods!](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.enumerations.methods.php).
* ID Pre-Generation can be handled by your database if you use [Maria DB](https://gist.github.com/gbirke/c77b0cd0f07763787796c4b3799a85a6).

## Professional

* 2 months away is all it takes to get out of the habit of doing code reviews in the mornings.
* Pair programming is a good way to ease back into the habit of architecture design & coding after a break.
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is quite nice and easy to use.
* Sat in on 2 pair programming technical interviews to learn how they're conducted.

## Personal Notes

* It's really hard to juggle a small kid and work during lockdown times.
