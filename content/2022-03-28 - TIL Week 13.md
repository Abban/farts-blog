A roundup of the things I learned in the 13th week of 2022.

## Technical

* In php if you have code on an abstract class that checks for interface implementations, when called by a child it will check what the child implements rather than the parent. This is handy when you have a few slightly differently functioning children.
* PhpStan [does not like this](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/narrowing-types#custom-type-checking-functions-and-methods) however. Though there is the possibility to make an [extension](https://phpstan.org/developing-extensions/type-specifying-extensions).
