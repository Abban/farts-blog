A roundup of the things I learned in the 9th week of 2022.

## Technical

* Doctrine doesn't escape column names so you shouldn't use a MySQL reserved word as a column name.
* To view the SQL you're trying to run in Doctrine you can set a logger
    ```php
    $debug = new DebugStack();
    $em->getConnection()->getConfiguration()->setSQLLogger($debug);
    // Do queries in try catch
    print_r($debug->queries);
    ```

## Professional

* Always test as close to production as possible. Because `interval` is not a reserved name in SQLite, but is in MySQL the Doctrine column name issue in **Technical** would have slipped through CI and caused production to break. This is because our test environment was using SQLite.

## Personal

* Coming soon to a post near you
