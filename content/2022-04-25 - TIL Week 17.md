A roundup of the things I learned in the 17th week of 2022.

## Technical

*Coming soon to a post near you*

## Professional

* Watched [Technical Leadership and Glue Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAPipnKqw). I highly recommend it. I've been struggling to get my head around the leadership responsibilities expected of me, and I liked having a clear explanation of how I can be doing things better.
* Tanya mentioned that scheduling fixed learning times for a team would help members feel like they're allowed to learn on the job, I think that's a brilliant idea.

## Personal Notes

* Bit burned out from obsessing on a pet project on my time off. We did a learning day in work and I really couldn't get my head into any of it. Ended up continuing with the refactor work we've been doing.
