A roundup of the things I learned in the 18th week of 2022.

## Technical

* PHP [Named Parameters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.named-arguments) are a good way of making different versions of an object you want to test that has a lot of constructor parameters. In your test you can add a method that returns your object with the constructor arguments as nullable parameters, then default them. Then when you need to pass different dependencies you can pass only the ones you want to modify as named parameters. Mini example:
```php
private function makeObjectToTest( ?string $name, ?string $description, ?SomeDependency $someDependency ): ObjectToTest {
    return new ObjectToTest(
        $name ?? 'Default',
        $description ?? 'Default',
        $someDependency ?? new SomeDependency()
    );
}

$objectWithCustomName = $this->makeObjectToTest( name: 'Name override' );
$objectWithCustomDependency = $this->makeObjectToTest( someDependency: new SomeDependencySpy() );
```

## Professional

* Been using [Codecks](https://codecks.io) for organising my pet project and I'm very into it.
* Did some [GUI design](/2022-05-03-game-development-gui).
* Watched a nice talk: [World Building in Blender - Ian Hubert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whPWKecazgM&t=0s).
