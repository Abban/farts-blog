A roundup of the things I learned from the 19th to the 22nd week of 2022.

## Technical

* Been re-reading Clean Architecture and implementing it in a game prototype in order to learn Clean and DDD in more detail.

## Professional

*Coming soon to a post near you*

## Personal Notes

Few weird weeks of family sickness meant it was hard to keep up blogging, so adding a roundup of what I remember. Gonna start putting what I've been watching and reading here unless I want to write something special about something.

* Watching the Resident Evil movies as they all hit Netflix.
* Watching Barry.
* Enjoying Ardal O'Hanlan on Taskmaster.
* Read the second Rosewater book.
* Reading the first Culture novel.
* Read Batman: The Long Halloween.
* Re-reading the Matt Fraction Hawkeye books.
