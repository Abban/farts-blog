It's been a long time since I made a WIP update on here but I've been very busy. Fuck so busy. I've been learning and applying web accessibility in my job which it turns out is extremely rewarding work, and it makes it hard to focus with intensity on 2 separate ongoing projects that I'm very invested in. But in that I still managed to get a lot of things done on the game. I'm so tired.

## I Turned my Village into a Town
{{< youtube "mhZh-_2gwPI" >}}

I wanted to test making towns and laying out scenery with splines so I spent a long time making modular houses in Blender and laying out a test town.

## I Made a Hay Shader
{{< youtube CIO2kxVhgJo >}}

UFOs require hayfields so I made a custom hay shader.

## Squiggler Beam

I added a second beam, this one is for drawing on the ground.

## Drawing in Hayfields
{{< youtube JdJ0QBW1dC4 >}}

I Linked my hay shader with the Squiggler and now the player can make crop circles.

## Bouncy Cow

I added a bounceable system that allows world objects to bounce on things.

## Go Kart Cow
{{< youtube 77ngQWGExS4 >}}

I figured out how to make kart tracks using a single spline. The Go kart follows the same spline to race around the track.

## Occult Cow
{{< youtube 80OsBSaKyuA >}}

Erm.. turn the page quick! Nothing to see here!

## Avatars
{{< youtube EGOR1LhDIeo >}}

I was going to make my avatars as 2D sprites but then had a fiddle with making them 3D and the results were pretty good, so now they're all squishy guys.

## Inventory and Cameras
{{< youtube fEaHjoR37eg >}}

I rebuilt the inventory so the player can see what's in there, and select stored items. I also hooked up a system to Yarn Spinner to allow me to change cameras for cut scenes betterly.
